Based on the theme "Connection and Time" provided by the organizers, we have developed a game with these creative elements:

Time: Inspired by Doctor Strange's mirror dimension, obstacles will appear randomly on the path. Time in the game is not only a survival element but is also expressed through the appearance of obstacles in distorted space, creating the feeling of moving through different dimensions of time.
Connection: Represented by the hand-holding of the couple, symbolized by the connection bar in the game. The bond between the two characters is not just a gameplay element but also conveys a message about sticking together and supporting each other to overcome difficulties.
 <p><em>The sidebar shows the intimacy between the two characters.</em></p> </div >  <h3 align="center">⚙️ GAME MECHANICS </h3>

Controls: The game is designed for 2 players on the same keyboard Male Character: Uses keys A (left), D (right), W (jump) 
Female Character: Uses arrow keys ← (left), → (right), ↑ (jump)
Movement Restrictions: Each character can only move in their own lane and cannot cross into the other player's lane. This creates a challenge of rhythmic coordination between the two players.
Each character has 2 lanes
Obstacles appear randomly on the road, the path changes continuously, the longer you run, the faster the speed increases
